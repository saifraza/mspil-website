## Leadership Images Status

### Working Images from CMS:
1. **Nawab Raza** - New upload working at:
   - `https://mspil-mcp-production.up.railway.app/uploads/nawab_raza_chairman_1749981518152.jpeg`

2. **Saif Raza** - Two images available:
   - PNG: `https://mspil-mcp-production.up.railway.app/uploads/1749415548895-IMG_1483.png`
   - JPEG: `https://mspil-mcp-production.up.railway.app/uploads/1749415548909-IMG_1480.jpeg`

### Issue Found:
- Old image uploads are being deleted from the server
- Frontend caches old URLs that no longer exist
- Need to clear browser cache after new uploads

### Solution:
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. If images still don't load, wait for Railway deployment to complete

   - `sahil-raza-image`
