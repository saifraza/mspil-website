# Static Upload System Guide

## Overview
We now have two ways to upload images to your website:

### 1. **Static Upload (Recommended)** ⚡
- Files are saved directly to the frontend's `/public` directory
- Images load instantly without any API calls
- Better performance and SEO
- Works exactly like the Nawab Raza image and company logo we just added

### 2. **CMS Upload** 🌐
- Files are uploaded to the CMS server
- Requires API calls to load images
- Good for dynamic content that changes frequently

## How to Use Static Upload

### Option 1: Direct File Copy (What we did for Nawab Raza)
```bash
# Copy image to appropriate public directory
cp "/path/to/image.png" "./public/images/leadership/team_member.png"

# Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "Add new image"
git push
```

### Option 2: Static Upload Server
1. Start the static upload server:
```bash
./upload-static.sh
```

2. Visit http://localhost:3000/static-upload in your browser

3. Select category and upload files

4. Files are automatically saved to the correct location in `/public`

5. Commit and push the changes:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add uploaded images"
git push
```

## Benefits of Static Files
1. **Fast Loading** - No server requests needed
2. **SEO Friendly** - Search engines can crawl images directly
3. **Offline Support** - Once cached, works without internet
4. **CDN Ready** - Can be served from CDN for global performance
5. **Version Control** - All images tracked in Git
