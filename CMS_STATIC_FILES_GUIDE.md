# CMS with Static Files Guide

## How It Works Now

The CMS server has been updated to save uploaded files directly to the frontend's `/public` directory. This means:

1. **Upload from anywhere** - Use the CMS interface from your phone or any device
2. **Files saved as static assets** - No API calls needed to display them
3. **Instant loading** - Just like the Nawab Raza image and company logo

## What Changed

### Before:
- Files uploaded to CMS server's `/uploads` directory
- Required API calls to fetch images
- URLs like: `https://cms-server.com/uploads/image.jpg`

### Now:
- Files saved directly to frontend's `/public` directory
- Served as static files
- URLs like: `/images/leadership/nawab_raza.png`

## How to Use

1. **Access CMS from your phone**:
   - Go to https://mspil.in/simple-cms
   - Login with your credentials

2. **Upload images**:
   - Select category (e.g., "Leadership Team")
   - Choose files from your phone
   - Add comments if needed
   - Click Upload

3. **Files are automatically**:
   - Saved to the correct `/public` folder
   - Given smart names based on category
   - Available instantly as static files

4. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Add new images via CMS"
   git push
   ```

## File Locations

When you upload via CMS, files go to these locations:

```
public/
├── images/
│   ├── leadership/       → Leadership Team photos
│   ├── media/           → Media Gallery
│   ├── news_media/      → News & Press
│   ├── office/          → Office & Facilities
│   ├── infrastructure/  → Infrastructure
│   ├── careers/         → Careers
│   └── csr/            → CSR Activities
│       ├── education/
│       ├── healthcare/
│       └── rural-development/
└── documents/
    ├── sugar-data/      → Sugar Production Data
    ├── ethanol-data/    → Ethanol Production Data
    └── investor-relations/
        ├── annual-reports/
        └── quarterly-results/
```

## Benefits

1. **Mobile Friendly** - Upload from your phone anywhere
2. **Fast Loading** - No server requests, instant display
3. **SEO Optimized** - Search engines can crawl static files
4. **Git Tracked** - All uploads tracked in version control
5. **Smart Naming** - Files automatically renamed based on category

## Example Flow

1. On your phone, go to `/simple-cms`
2. Login
3. Upload "Board Meeting.jpg" to "Leadership Team"
4. File is saved as `/public/images/leadership/team_member_2025-06-15_board_meeting_1234.jpg`
5. Instantly available at `https://mspil.in/images/leadership/team_member_2025-06-15_board_meeting_1234.jpg`
6. Later, commit and push from your laptop

## Important Notes

- Files are saved to the frontend repository, not the CMS
- You need to commit and push changes for them to appear in production
- The CMS interface works the same, but files are stored differently
- Old uploads will still work but new ones use static paths
